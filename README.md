# Lab 6: Performance Comparison of Memory Handling Techniques in CUDA
## Overview
This project contains CUDA programs for the performance comparison of three different memory handling techniques: traditional memcpy, pinned memory, and Unified Virtual Memory (UVM). The comparison is conducted across a range of data sizes to evaluate the efficiency of each method.

## Prerequisites
To use this project, ensure you have the following installed:

### CUDA Toolkit
### A CUDA-capable GPU
### GNU Make

## How to Use the Makefile
The included Makefile simplifies the process of compiling and running the CUDA programs. Below are the commands you can use:

## Compile All Programs
To compile all the CUDA programs, run the following command in the terminal:


```bash
make
```
This will compile vector_add_Memcpy.cu, vector_add_Pinned.cu, and vector_add_UVM.cu, creating executable files for each.

## Run All Programs
To execute all compiled programs with specified data sizes, use the following command:

```bash
make run
```
This command will run each executable with a range of data sizes, from 32B to 2GB.

## Clean Up
To remove all the compiled executables, execute the following command:

```bash
make clean
```

This will clean up your project directory by deleting all executable files generated by the Makefile.
